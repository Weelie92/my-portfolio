          I was born and raised in Mandal. Growing up, I was always interested in technology. It wasnt uncommon to find me taking apart my toys to see how they
          work. I also loved the outdoors and spent a lot of time hiking and exploring the woods near my home. I have always been a curious person, and I always
          had a passion for learning.
